# Flow Visualization

This project proposes the creation of a 3D network data visualization application that creates both dynamic and interactive visuals. This tool will be built as a web application using the Babylon.js framework along with Blender for both the 3D meshes and animations. The project will use an anonymized Netflow dataset, provided by the University of Arkansas network team, to both test and demonstrate the visualization application.

Previous network visualization projects have primarily been 2D. Those that have attempted to use 3D visuals are difficult to analyze and lack user interaction. Above is the depiction of a common 3D network visualization.

The network traffic for this project is being gathered from five different buildings on campus. To preserve the network’s security, the data is initially collected on a secured computer. Then, automatically, the IPs within the data will be anonymized and transferred to the pick up computer.

Visualizations generated by this project were inspired by Solar System models. The large spheres represent individual network devices and their size indicates the amount of traffic they have processed. The smaller spheres represent ports for the corresponding network devices that they “orbit”. Connections are drawn between either ports or devices.
