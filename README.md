# Flow Visualization

This project proposes the creation of a 3D network data visualization application that creates both dynamic and interactive visuals. This tool will be built as a web application using the Babylon.js framework along with Blender for both the 3D meshes and animations. The project will use an anonymized Netflow dataset, provided by the University of Arkansas network team, to both test and demonstrate the visualization application.
